        So I’m gonna put (a lot of) my reflection on a song/artist today. If my memory is correct, last time I did was a presentation on OneRepublic out of all the pop rock/alt rock bands I could have chosen in high school. If my memory is correct again, 2023 was the first time I went to a concert with my own money. 4 of them as of now, each having a different vibe and a distinct memory. I’m gonna talk about a certain one here though, probably not the best, but the most memorable and journal-able, as there were too many aspects that made it stand out.

        I listen to music more often than I exercise, and probably even more than I scroll social media. First half isn’t a good sign but at least second half seems to be, I guess. Along with random songs thanks to the rigged unpaid spotify algorithm, there always seems to be that one song that I go to, and listen to on repeat, the primary reason being the song relating so much with my mood and what I am going through at the time. Around September/October, which was by no means happier times, it was the by no means happy song This City by Sam Fischer. I later found out the singer-songwriter was from Sydney, the city I had been living in for the past 3 years. Then on one of those days when I was in a phase of (quite desperately) needing stuff to do to spend my free time (that was before journaling came into the picture ofc), especially in evenings, Facebook algorithm lords blessed me with an ad of Sam Fischer’s album release mini-concert the next day. I snatched a late ticket, positively thinking that the reasonable price won’t cause me to regret later. I also decided that I would experience going to Sam’s concert alone, all things considered, from not being able to interact and talk much to anyone in a small space with loud music where people are more focused on enjoying the music, to leaving it too late to buy a ticket to think of inviting anyone without seeming too impolite :D

        So I left work on a Tuesday afternoon as usual, and grabbed a quick fast food dinner before arriving at the venue, a small underground bar near Circular Quay. People had already been lining up 10 minutes before the concert started - to be fair, he’s pretty popular locally as well as internationally. A note for concert-goers in Sydney (probably applicable in other places as well) is to empty your water bottles before entry, or you’d have to watch the trees enjoying your ice-cold water straight out of your company cafeteria instead. There was a bar to enjoy the drinks, however I didn’t get any as the amount I spent that night was already starting to make me sweat. I do recommend getting a drink looking back, the right drink always seems to get you in the right mood. The first hour or first half of a concert of this type is usually opening acts, often of a similar lane in music for the audience to enjoy. I discovered a great song (link below), and the artist, Jacob Fitzgerald, also had a cool stripped down performance of the classic Down Under (it’s the meme boy personality in me that was awaken, so pardon me).

        The opening acts were cool, and Sam Fischer finally arrived in the flesh. It was a new album release, so the majority of the songs were unreleased. Therefore, I’ll stop pretending to be the cool indie kid who introduces y’all to hidden gems, and talk about his two biggest hits instead, as the impact of the songs on me were just as big. “What Other People Say” was his hit song with Demi Lovato, and his introduction made the crowd scream as we thought Demi was actually coming. She didn’t, but it was great regardless, also Guy Sebastian did arrive later instead, which was a complete surprise as there wasn’t a single sneak peek. “The biggest artist in Australia”, Sam introduced him as, and I remember really enjoying his powerful voice as well as loving him as a coach on The Voice. Sam told the story about the fanboying moment of how Guy texted him in his dms praising his song after hearing it many years ago, and there was me standing in the audience having a fanboy moment over both of them. Anyway back to “What Other People Say”, not sure if this interruption style is acceptable in a journal but that’s me in real life so bear with it for now as we should all kEeP iT rEaL. Before the song started, Sam led the crowd saying out loud “Fuck what other people say” several times. It was satisfying and somewhat powerful, considering that was likely the unfiltered meaning behind the track. “Unfiltered” is also the word I would use to describe the audience, or at least myself at that time. I was lost in the moment and the music, relating to myself at that time at the final stages of recovering from being a people pleaser and letting society’s so-called standards and other people’s words being too much of an influence for me and a definition of who I am, most of whom aren’t even that much of an influence. “‘Now I’m all fucked up and my heart’s changed, ‘cause I care more about what other people say”, that was the state I was in. At one point I was (gradually and unawarely, I think) changing my personality, my way of talking to people and the pastime activities I do just to fit the mold of what society seems to think is cool, attractive or successful, and to fit in better with the crowd, and in the end, I felt like the meme “I’ve won, but at what cost”, except I didn’t even win anything and felt no joy being a wannabe and not being myself. No matter what personality I show to people there are always gonna be as many haters as there are lovers, so fuck what other people say, I’m just gonna be comfortable being myself in order to enjoy this life.

        The show unsurprisingly closed with Sam calling for Sydney to sing This City with him. Both the song and WOPS were written about his experience being in LA, as Sam told us in the show, and LA seems to be a scary place based on how it’s depicted in music. I remember first listening to Panic! At the Disco’s Dying in LA back in the pandemic, a song with a similar theme about feeling lost and lonely in a new city, and my first reaction was relating to literally every lyric, just swapping LA for Sydney, and I felt it again, and felt it harder, when I heard Sam singing This City live and telling the story behind it. Line by line it went, “I’ve been seeing lonely people in crowded rooms” - that was me, and probably most of the people surrounding me. As I was making a transition to the average adult life by definition, with 9 to 5 work and doing socially acceptable activities instead of hobbies that are more often deemed impractical than not, I realized that most of our time would be spent alone, and everyone is so busy with their own lives and issues to take part in each other’s, making us all “lonely people in crowded rooms”. Lately, I’d been trying out some new things to be productive in my abundance of free time, so I can be “alone but not lonely”, including venting out stuff in my head into this wall of text, which gradually helped me release the negative energy that had been exhausting me for a while, and I left it here as a suggestion that hopefully could help as you’re reading this.

        “This city’s gonna love me and leave me alone” is the line that pretty much sums up my entire experience living in Sydney. There were many periods of time that you enjoy a city or a place so much, you felt like you loved the city and the city loved you, particularly when you started moving to a new city with all the excitement and prospects. It was less than a month from my first day living full-time in Sydney that covid went full force, so my experience in this city was more of the second half of the line than the first. It took me more than a year to start going out and basically living a normal pre-covid life again, and to feel the love in this city again. But stuff happens as life goes on, and as mentioned, the further you go in adulthood the more you seem to be left alone, and many more times had I been left disappointed and underwhelmed in the city. I gradually realized that “this city loving me” and “this city leaving me alone” were parts of a cycle, or an infinite loop, as us programmers like to call it, and we just gotta learn to cope with the inevitable bad phase of the cycle, lowkey similarly to how we coped with covid.

        I’ve always been more of a lyrics person when it comes to listening to music, which probably doesn’t come as a surprise, therefore song lyrics that hit close to home would make their way into my playlists, or journal. “Writes uncomplicated, honest truths about himself and his life in the hopes that someone will find comfort in his words when they can’t find them themselves.” - Sam Fischer’s Spotify bio reads, and I felt it. I felt the simplicity yet depth in his lyrics, and I felt the comfort and relatability in his words, sometimes so much I thought those words were mine, or were about me. So no false advertising, can verify that Fischer is legit. Enough self-reflection, I know y’all are probably here for the concert review rather than hearing some random bloke babbling on about how he relates to some sad pop song’s lyrics. Sam was a class act and his live vocals were really good. Having been to a concert of this scale alone and with a friend, I do think going with someone is more enjoyable, even though you wouldn’t have that much time interacting during the performances anyway as the sound would often be too loud for that, the vibes when you have company would still be there, regardless. And the concert just happened to be at the right place at the right time for me and my mood, which is the chocolate chip on top of the icing (I don’t like cherries or sprinkles on my cake so let me just invent a new idiom). My spontaneous decisions often resulted in more negative than desirable results, but I can conclude today’s article with saying that buying a ticket to Sam Fischer’s show on October 17, 2023 is hands down the best last-minute decision ever.
