                DÅ©ng (Call me Jonathan 'cause there's a high probability that you'll butcher the pronunciation of my birth name which is fine). 22. 
                Hanoi born and raised. Currently residing, vibing and surviving in Sydney. Used to spend too much time thinking about
                random and spontaneous things, so decided to spend that time writing them down to release the negative energy instead
                of carrying it. Will probably be pretty scarce in posting frequency as this is a hobby/side hustle that doesn't earn money
                but do keep an eye out for new posts (this lowkey gives out fans waiting for their idols' albums vibes which is cool except I'm no idol lol) So, 
                if y'all actually make it to this page and spend your time reading my writing here, thanks for stopping by and hope it has a sorta 
                similar comforting effect on you, or just brings a new perspective on random things that may intrigue y'all.
