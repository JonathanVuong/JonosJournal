                DÅ©ng (Call me Jonathan 'cause there's a high probability that you'll butcher my birth name which is fine). 22. 
                Hanoi born and raised. Currently residing, vibing and surviving in Sydney. Head constantly filled with thoughts, most
                of the time random and spontaneous ones, so putting them out into words here in an attempt to release the inner negative 
                energy accumulated by carrying all such thoughts and ideas. Will probably be pretty scarce in posting frequency as this is 
                a hobby/side hustle that doesn't pay but do keep an eye out for new posts (this lowkey gives out fans waiting for their idols' albums vibes which is cool except I'm no idol lol) So, 
                if y'all actually make it to this page and spend your time reading my writing here, thanks for stopping by and hope it has a sorta 
                similar positive effect on you, or just brings a new perspective on random things that may intrigue y'all.
