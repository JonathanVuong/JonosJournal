                DÅ©ng (Call me Jonathan 'cause there's a high probability that you'll butcher my birth name which is fine). 22. 
                Hanoi born and raised. Currently residing, vibing and surviving in Sydney. Putting my, most of the time,
                spontaneous and random thoughts into words, as most of the time I fail to do so in everyday conversations, 
                and take this journal as another one of my attempts to be creative. So, welcome aboard, and if you do actually spend 
                time reading it, thanks and hope my whole mess of various content bring you some sort of feelings that you hopefully want 
                to feel, and a new, different and unexpected perspective to random things that may intrigue y'all.
